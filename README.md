## Installing Python on your local machine

Python is usually already installed on your machine. To check, type `python --version` in a terminal.

Here are 3 different methods to install Python:

1. Instally Python manually (<https://www.python.org/downloads/>):

   * This will get you the latest version of Python3
   * You will now need to use the command `python3` instead of `python` (unless you create an alias by adding the line `alias python=python3` in your .bash_profile)

2. Installing Python using Anaconda (<https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual>):

   * Anaconda is a data science platform by Continuum Analytics that comes with a lot of useful features right out of the box
   * Many people find that installing Python through Anaconda is much easier than doing so manually (see method #1 above)
   * Anaconda comes with Conda, which is Continuum's package, dependency and environment manager (analogous to pip for Python)
   * The libraries and packages included in Anaconda are usually related to data science (numpy, scipy, jupyter notebooks, etc.)
   * Benefits:
       + Simplify common problems
       + Great for use in the classroom as it provides each student with the same setup

3. Installing Python using Miniconda (<https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>):

   * Miniconda is a free minimal installer for conda
   * Good if hard drive space is an issue for you
   * It is a small bootstrapped version of Anaconda that comes with the Python distribution, essential packages, and conda.
